# Joey Sandoval's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This application showcases my skills, projects, and professional background. It is built using React and includes four main sections: About Me, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact.

## Features

### About Me

The About Me page provides an introduction to who I am, my educational background, and my interests in programming and computer science. It includes a brief biography and a profile picture.

### Portfolio

The Portfolio page highlights some of the projects I have worked on. Each project includes a title, a brief description, an image, and links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Here are a few examples:

- **Gardening Scheduler**: A web application to help users schedule and manage their gardening tasks.
- **Weather Dashboard**: A dashboard that provides weather information for different cities.
- **Employee Management CLI**: A command-line interface for managing employee data.

### Resume

The Resume page provides a downloadable link to my resume. It also includes a summary of my professional experience, education, and skills.
